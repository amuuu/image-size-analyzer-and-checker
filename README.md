# Fast Image Resizer
A simple program to resize images.
## How To Use
Open terminal and run this command:
```
python main.py path/to/image.jpg PROCESS_TYPE TARGET_X TARGET_Y
```
PROCESS_TYPE is either "rescale", "resize", or "downscale".

If you wanted to rescale, just enter your desired scale after the process type. Otherwise, enter both the x and y coordinates of your target after process type.

**Note:** Most of the time we use rescale.
